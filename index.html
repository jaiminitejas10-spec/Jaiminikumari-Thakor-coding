<h1>Hobby as Travel</h1>

<p>
  Travel as a hobby opens the door to discovering new cultures, foods, and experiences.
  It refreshes the mind and inspires creativity through exposure to different environments.
  I enjoy visiting places that offer a mix of nature, history, and adventure. Some of my
  favorite places include Kusadasi for its calm temples, Paris for its artistic charm, and
  Bali for its vibrant beaches. Each journey brings unique sights, flavors, and memories
  that refresh the mind and spark creativity.
